# GCP Audit Log Detections Mod for Powerpipe

[Tailpipe](https://tailpipe.io) is an open-source CLI tool that allows you to collect logs and query them with SQL.

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The [GCP Audit Log Detections Mod](https://hub.powerpipe.io/mods/turbot/tailpipe-mod-gcp-audit-log-detections) contains pre-built dashboards and detections, which can be used to monitor and analyze activity across your GCP projects.

terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run gcp_audit_log_detections.benchmark.mitre_attack_v161
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
