## Overview

Detect when an IAM federated identity provider was updated in GCP. Federated identity providers enable external identities to access GCP resources, and unauthorized or unintended updates can compromise security or disrupt integrations. Monitoring these events ensures proper governance and prevents unauthorized modifications to identity provider configurations.
