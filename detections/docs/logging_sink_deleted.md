## Overview

Detect when a logging sink was deleted in GCP. Logging sinks are essential for exporting logs to external destinations, and their deletion can disrupt log analysis, monitoring, and compliance processes. Monitoring these events ensures the continuity of logging workflows and prevents unauthorized or accidental removal of sinks.
