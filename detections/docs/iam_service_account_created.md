## Overview

Detect when an IAM service account was created in GCP. Service accounts are used by applications and services to access GCP resources, and unauthorized or unintended creation of service accounts can lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Monitoring these events helps ensure proper governance and prevents security risks.
