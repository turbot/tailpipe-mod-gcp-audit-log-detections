## Overview

Detect when a monitoring metric descriptor was deleted in GCP. Metric descriptors define the structure of metrics, and their deletion can disrupt monitoring workflows and impact the visibility of system performance and operations. Monitoring these events ensures proper tracking of metrics and prevents unauthorized or accidental removal of critical metric definitions.
