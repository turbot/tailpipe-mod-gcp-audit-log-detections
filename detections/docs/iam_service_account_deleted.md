## Overview

Detect when an IAM service account was deleted in GCP. Service accounts are essential for applications and services to access GCP resources, and their deletion can disrupt operations or indicate unauthorized activity. Monitoring these events ensures operational continuity and prevents accidental or unauthorized removal of critical service accounts.
