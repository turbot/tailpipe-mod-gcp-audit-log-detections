## Overview

Detect when an IAM policy was set in GCP Resource Manager. Unauthorized or accidental changes to IAM policies can expose resources to security risks, disrupt access controls, or indicate misconfigurations. Monitoring these events ensures proper access governance and prevents unauthorized modifications.
