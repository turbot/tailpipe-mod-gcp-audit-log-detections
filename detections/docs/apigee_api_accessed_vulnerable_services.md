## Overview

Detect instances where an Apigee API accesses potentially vulnerable services. Such access might indicate a misconfiguration or a security incident where unsafe services are exposed through Apigee APIs. Monitoring these activities helps ensure that APIs are not inadvertently exposing systems to exploitation and supports secure API management practices.
