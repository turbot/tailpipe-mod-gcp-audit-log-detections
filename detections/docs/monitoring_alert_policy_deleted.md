## Overview

Detect when a monitoring alert policy was deleted in GCP. Alert policies are critical for detecting and responding to performance issues or security incidents, and their deletion can lead to missed alerts and delayed responses. Monitoring these events ensures the continuity of alerting workflows and prevents unauthorized or accidental removal of critical policies.
