## Overview

Detect when an IAM organization policy was updated in GCP. Organization policies enforce governance and compliance by restricting resource configurations, and unauthorized or unintended updates can weaken security and lead to policy violations. Monitoring these events ensures proper enforcement of organizational policies and prevents unauthorized modifications.
